# README

This project will one day be a full-fledged application. It isn't much now, but I am learning Swift while chipping away at putting my idea into code.

I am attempting to create an app that allows users to communicate in Morse code. The version in this repository will be the iPhone version, but there may also be an Android version. Users will be able to tap on the screen to construct a Morse code app and then the recipients of those messages will feel them via vibration. I have other ideas as well, as the possibilities are virtually endless. With that being said, the basic functionality is a good starting point for my knowledge. I hope to publish this.
